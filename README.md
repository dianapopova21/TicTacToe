# Tic-Tac-Toe
My small project is a tic-tac-toe game with the ability to play with a bot. In this project, I embodied my knowledge in programming and logic, creating interesting and educational entertainment.

Tic-tac-toe is a classic game and the addition of a bot as an adversary adds interest to it. I developed an algorithm that allows the bot to make intelligent decisions and confront the player. The bot can analyze the current state of the playing field, predict the player's moves and make the best decisions to win or prevent defeat.
